I am taking this bootcamp to learn the necessary web coding technologies that will allow me to get a job in my field.  I love to code and have a passion for coding, so it would make me very happy to make a living with full-time status.

The most important thing for me to learn would be Javascript, WebAPI, and MVC.

I want to work at a company that cares for their employees and allows them to work without much direction, as well as, have fun.
